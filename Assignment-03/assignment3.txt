 What is JSX ?
 -> It is Javascript syntax which is easier to create react elements.

 SuperPower of JSX
 -> We can use javascript in JSX using {}  (curly brackets)
 -> We can use element and function in jsx using js

 {TitleComponent()} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX
 -> This all are same i.e calling function in another component and component within component
